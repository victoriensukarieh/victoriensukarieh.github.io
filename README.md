### Hello I am Victorien Sukarieh and this is my "Personal Website"
This repo host my persenal portfolio that i am bulding from scratch.
Every time i learn a new thing and feel i need it in my website i add it.
This is the first real project i am working on, i am going through web development
one step at a time. So far i created the HTML and now working on CSS.
I may be going slowly but it is better than not moving at all.<br/>
**Building my career one small step at a time.**
